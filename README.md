## Overview
The science of training machines to learn and produce models for future predictions is widely used with the hope of predicting future yields and minimizing loss, as agriculture plays a critical role in the global economy. With the continual expansion of the human population, understanding the world's crop yield is central to addressing food security challenges and reducing the impacts of climate change.

Crop yield prediction is an important agricultural problem. Agricultural yield primarily depends on weather conditions (rain, temperature, etc.), as well as pesticides. Accurate information about the history of crop yield is an important factor in making decisions related to agricultural risk management and future predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: 
dataset 1: [Crop Yield Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset)
dataset 2: [Agriculture Crop Yield](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelotiattakorah/agriculture-crop-yield). 

## About Dataset (2) 
This dataset contains agricultural data for 1,000,000 samples aimed at predicting crop yield (in tons per hectare) based on various factors. The dataset can be used for regression tasks in machine learning, especially for predicting crop productivity.

- Region: The geographical region where the crop is grown (North, East, South, West).
- Soil_Type: The type of soil in which the crop is planted (Clay, Sandy, Loam, Silt, Peaty, Chalky).
- Crop: The type of crop grown (Wheat, Rice, Maize, Barley, Soybean, Cotton).
- Rainfall_mm: The amount of rainfall received in millimeters during the crop growth period.
- Temperature_Celsius: The average temperature during the crop growth period, measured in degrees Celsius.
- Fertilizer_Used: Indicates whether fertilizer was applied (True = Yes, False = No).
- Irrigation_Used: Indicates whether irrigation was used during the crop growth period (True = Yes, False = No).
- Weather_Condition: The predominant weather condition during the growing season (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy).
- Days_to_Harvest: The number of days taken for the crop to be harvested after planting.
- Yield_tons_per_hectare: The total crop yield produced, measured in tons per hectare.
